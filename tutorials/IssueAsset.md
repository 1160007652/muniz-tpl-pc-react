Now that we have created our first asset, we can move on to asset issuance. This is the act of issuing units of your asset onto the ledger.

1. Click on "Issue Asset" in the side menu.
2. Select wallet you issed the asset from in the "Issuer" field
3. In the "Asset" field, choose the asset code that belongs to the asset you created in the previous tutorial. The asset name will appear below the field.
4. Enter the amount you would like to issue, let's start with 50000. 
5. Click on "Issue"
6. Set "Blind Amount" to "No". This determines wether the amount issued is visible on the ledger or hidden from other observers.

7. Check that the values in the popup window match those in the Issue Asset page. Then click "Confirm". You will be greeted with "Asset issuance succeeded" message.
8. Click on "Done". You have now issued your first asset on the Findora ledger!

8. Click on the "Transactions" tab in the side menu. Click on the transaction labeled "Issuance" to see further details of your issuance. Note the number underneath "Txn". This is the transaction id, or tx_id, of your asset issuance. 
9. You can check the ledger manually for your tx_id to confirm your asset was issued correctly using this [link](https://testnet.findora.org:8668/blocks_since/0).

### [Learning WebAssembly (WASM)](https://www.rust-lang.org/what/wasm)

### Tips
#### 1. Unable to use WASM in Google Chrome Extension
> Solution

Add the following to `manifest.json`.
```json
"content_security_policy": "script-src 'self' 'wasm-eval'; object-src 'self'"
```

#### 2. Unable to use WASM in Webpack
> Solution

Since the WASM used in the Findora Wallet Application is the `es6` module compiled from Rust, and Webpack doesn't support synchronously importing WASM modules, add the following to import WASM asynchronously.
```js
import('wasm');
```
With Webpack 4, in the `es6` module generated by `wasm-pack`, the following code will be included in `wasm.js` to import `wasm_bg.wasm`.
```js
import * as wasm from './wasm_bg.wasm';
```

Let's try transfering the asset we just issued. Start by repeating the "Create a Wallet" tutorial. Name the new wallet "Bob".

1. If we click on "Wallets" in the side menu we should now see our "Alice" and "Bob" wallet. The strings underneath the names are the public keys tied to the wallets that can be used to receive assets. 
2. Click on the copy icon at the right side of the wallet. A checkmark appears when copied.

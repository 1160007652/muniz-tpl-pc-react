Now that we have created our first wallet, let's take a look at creating our first asset. Assets in Findora can be transfered without revealing their type and amount.

1. Click on "Create Asset" in the side menu. 
2. Choose the wallet you want as issuer. The public key associated with the wallet will be shown underneath the "Issuer" field.
4. The "Asset" field shows the unique identifier generated by the Findora system that can be used to distinguish your asset from others with the same name.
5. In the "Memo" field enter the name of your asset. Let's test with "My First Asset". 
6. Set "Max Units Limit" to "No". This setting allows your asset to have no cap on future issuance.
7. Set "Transferable" to "Yes". This setting makes your asset freely transferable.
8. Click on "Create".

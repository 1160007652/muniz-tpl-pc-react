1. Click on "Create Asset" in the side menu. 
2. Choose the wallet you want as issuer. The public key associated with the wallet will be shown underneath the "Issuer" field.

5. In the "Memo" field enter the name of your asset. Let's test with "My First Asset". 
6. Set "Max Units Limit" to - [x] No
